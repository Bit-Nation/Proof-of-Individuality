[Johan Nygren's](https://github.com/resilience-me) POI protocol - virtual pseudonym parties - Bitnation use case 

Virtual Pseudonym Parties is based on Bryan Ford's idea for Pseudonym Parties, which groups all users together based on their location, and does simultaneous verification parties, where the proof is that you cannot be in two places at once. The Virtual Pseudonym Parties, rather than happening in the offline world, take place online, using video hangouts.
